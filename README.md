Leveraging 13 Classifiers and Regression Models for Robust Diabetes Risk Assessment and Prediction
aims to explore and evaluate the effectiveness of various machine learning models in classifying and predicting diabetes risk. The dataset was first subjected to thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand key features and patterns. Subsequently, 13 classifiers and regression models were implemented to assess their accuracy in predicting diabetic outcomes.

The performance of these models varied, with the Random Forest (RF) classifier achieving the highest accuracy at 72.93%, closely followed by the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) at 72.18% and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) at 70.67%. The Extra Trees (ET) classifier also performed well with an accuracy of 70.67%. Other models, including Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), achieved accuracies of 67.66% and 66.91%, respectively. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model yielded a lower accuracy of 33.08%, while Naive Bayes (GNB) and Decision Tree (DT) models showed moderate performance with accuracies of 55.63% and 52.63%.

The study highlights the potential of ensemble methods like RF and KNN in providing robust predictive capabilities for diabetes risk assessment, while also pointing out the limitations of certain models in this context.
